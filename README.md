I'm Sajeed Ansari

"For the past two years, I’ve been practicing Java with DSA.
I take an evaluative approach to solving problems and work through the process by trying out various solutions. 
I’m a self-starter and work well independently, but I’m also skilled at working in teams.
I’m used to working in fast-paced environments and am very driven by goals and deadlines.”
